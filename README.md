# threestudio-lrm
The threestudio-lrm is an extension for threestudio, integrating the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for advanced 3D reconstruction tasks. This model is based on the framework detailed at [https://yiconghong.me/LRM/](https://yiconghong.me/LRM/). We have adapted the open-source implementation from [OpenLRM](https://github.com/3DTopia/OpenLRM). Currently, it is only used for initialization of [threestudio-gaussiandreamer](https://github.com/cxh0519/threestudio-gaussiandreamer.git).

## Installation
```
cd custom
git clone https://github.com/cxh0519/threestudio-lrm
cd threestudio-lrm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€Quick Start
See [threestudio-gaussiandreamer](https://github.com/cxh0519/threestudio-gaussiandreamer.git).

## ðŸ“¢Discussion
**Difference with original** [threestudio-lrm](https://github.com/Adamdad/threestudio-lrm)

* Using lrm+MVDream initailzation instead of lrm+SDXL. Compared to SDXL, MVDream generates more appropriate front/side view images for given text prompt.
